# 🩺 Kidney Disease Prediction  

A Machine Learning-based web application to predict the likelihood of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) from medical parameters. The project uses the **Random Forest algorithm** for prediction with a **Flask backend** and a simple **web-based frontend**.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
-  Predicts the likelihood of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).  
-  Uses **Random Forest Classifier** for reliable predictions.  
-  Flask-based backend for handling model inference.  
-  Simple and interactive web interface for input and results.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

### 🔙 Backend (Python)  
- **Flask** → Lightweight web framework to handle requests and serve pages.  
- **Scikit-learn** → For training the Random Forest Classifier model.  
- **Pandas** → For data cleaning and preparation of the CSV dataset.  
- **Joblib** → For saving and loading the trained ML model without retraining.  

### 🌐 Frontend (Web)  
- **HTML** → Structures the web page with input forms and result display.  
- **CSS** → Styles the interface with modern effects .  
- **JavaScript** → Handles interaction, sends input data to Flask, and updates the result dynamically.

## 📊 Dataset  
- Based on patient medical records (`Kidney_disease_data.csv`).  
- Features include blood pressure, blood glucose, hemoglobin, etc.  
- Target: Presence or absence of **Chronic Kidney Disease**.
